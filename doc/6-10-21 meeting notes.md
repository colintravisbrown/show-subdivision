# 6/10/21- meeting notes

## For sphere factor and cage orientations:
  - maybe provide multiple outputs and have them choose the best looking to put in the figure.
  - Later perhaps find algorithm that can approximate sphere factor

## common project:
  - read Noble paper
  - work on integrating protocols from the paper 

**postpone intense week**

prepare for short meetings every week or few days ~10-15 minutes for updating progress

## minimum viable product:
  - hk97 folds
  - might have 30-40 molecular models
  - how can we generate evidence on what lattice they form
  - do a summary
  - and publish.

## **Most immediate thing**
  - how to process 40 structures without having painful repetition.

## Short term:
  - how can we make the figure without having to manually generate one by one figures

## Which parts of the figures can be automated at this moment:
  - if we have info for panel A, how much can we do automatically.
    
  - Might need user to specify which proteins to look at for pentamer/hexamer

- when you look at different structure pentamer might not always be same chain number,
- no systematic way people are labeling chain structures
idea:
  - if we know the chain where we have pentamer, is there a way to generate the pentamer views


## **for now: ASSUME WE HAVE INFORMATION FROM PANEL A AND H,K VALUES**
# short term goal: 
  - generate A and the rest of the panels

## for generating figure,
  - use matplotlib for ease of rendering and manipulation
  -  wonâ€™t look as good as illustrator but will be functional
